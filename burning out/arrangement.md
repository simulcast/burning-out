#Burning Out
##Arrangement
##Production

#Intro
descending progression in D major...
D, D/C#, Bmin, A, G, G/F#, Emin

acoustic guitar
needs something textural

#Verse 1
same progression

vocals come in

#Instrumental Interlude
same progression

drums [sk-1 flute] and key lead [sk-1 flute] come in
drums could be casio sk-1 played loud through guitar amp
or could be a drum kit
or both

bass needs to be electric, played by someone more skilled than me – more than just roots

#Verse 2
vocals back, instrumentation remains
same progression except 2nd time through the harmonic rhythm picks up after "root of all displacement"
Bmin, A, G
everything cuts on G to a field recording on final "i used to hear the city singing"
let it hang for a long time

#Outro
same progression
just acoustic guitar, textures, field recording
