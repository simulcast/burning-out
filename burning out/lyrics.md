#Burning Out
##Lyrics

##verse 1
i can’t keep living like i’m living
i cannot give like i’ve been giving
i was caught between the river and the five

in every tanker and reflection, i see a sky of imperfection
i used to hear the city singing
now i’m just reading lines

##instrumental interlude

##verse 2
i can’t keep hurting then returning
i cannot burn like i’ve been burning
i was riding out the north pacific high

in every mustard bloom embankment, i see the root of all displacement
i used to hear the city singing
now it’s saying goodbye

##outro
