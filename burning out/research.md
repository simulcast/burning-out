#Burning Out
##Research

##Personal narrative
this is a song about winter into spring / summer 2019. feeling a verdant winter followed by a total dry-out.
i hit a wall and exhausted myself.
i was commuting on the 5 every day, from my apartment in highland park to sonora recorders in atwater village.
i would start at the arroyo, rushing with water, and end by the los angeles river, often testing its flood control capacities.
i watched the elysian hills go from brown to bloom, earth to green. then back to brush.
i started taking "selfies" in the oil tankers i'd drive behind. i loved how their elliptical lenses framed the sky.


##North Pacific High
- weather pattern that contributes to drought conditions, 2011-2017
- what's happening when it rains?

##Oil Tankers on the 5
- what are they carrying? where do they come from (harbor, probably) and where are they going?

##Mustard flowers
- invasive colonial plant, brought over by spanish colonizers
- sucks up water resources from native plants, grows tall and then dries out, becoming fuel for future fires
